## 📦 Component Breakdown

### `Agent/agent2.py`
The main LangChain-powered AI agent:
- Handles user queries
- Uses a Pinecone vector database for CCI knowledge
- Injects structured events into the prompt
- Stores long-term memory by `user_id`
- Key function: `agent_response(message, user_id)`

---

### `Data/raw/evenements.json`
Raw events scraped from the CCI website (monthly).  
Used as the source file for formatting.

---

### `Data/processed/evenements_structures.txt`
Cleaned and formatted version of the event data.  
This is **directly injected into the prompt** to inform the AI of upcoming events.

---

### `Processing/scraper.py`
Script that scrapes event information from the CCI website.  
It writes the output to `evenements.json`.  
> To be run **monthly** (e.g. manually or via CRON job).

---

### `Processing/formatter.py`
Cleans and formats `evenements.json` into the prompt-ready `evenements_structures.txt`.

---

### `.env`
Environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`
- `PINECONE_ENV`
- `PINECONE_INDEX`
